# Initial version

## Tables

* As a user, I want to see how many objects are indexed from which fedora instance so that I can get a sense of what content I'm looking at.
* As a user, I want to see how much total storage fedora objects are taking so that I can monitor file system use.
* As a user, I want to see statistics for xml, binary, master, and access datastreams and total object size so that I can get a sense of
the range and totals for object and file sizes in the repository.
* As a user, I want to see the number of objects by content model so that I can see how much content there is for the types present in the repository.
* As a user, I want to see the number of objects by collection so that I can see how content is organized.
* As a user, I want to see the number of objects and size by primary content mimetype so that I can see the distribution and file usage by kind of file.
* As a user, I want to see the number of objects and size by object state so that I can see the number and file usage of inactive and deleted objects.
* As a user, I want to see the number of datastream versions and size by mimetype so that I can see the total number and file usage by kind of file for all content in the repository.
* As a user, I want to see the number of datastream versions and size by control group so that I can see the total number and file usage for external, inline, and managed content.

## Charts

* As a user, I want to see a graph of master datastream  content size by content type so that I can get a sense of the relative size distributions of different kinds of objects.
* As a user, I want to see a treemap of the number of objects by collection so that I can get a sense of relative collection size.
* As a user, I want to see a treemap of the number of objects by master content mimetype so that I can get a sense of relative numbers of major and minor mimetypes in the repository.
* As a user, I want to see a treemap of the size of master content mimetype so that I can get a sense of relative file usage for major and minor mimetypes in the repository.

## Admin

* As a user, I want to compare the number of objects indexed by content model to totals from the Fedora RIsearch triplestore so that I can easily check to see what content is not accounted for.

##  todo / not yet implemented:

* As a user, I want to see the collection totals grouped by parent collection so that I can get a better sense of the amount of content in the repository and how it is organized.
